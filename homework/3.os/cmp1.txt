Lashley pioneered experimental work conducted on rats with surgically induced brain lesions, by damaging or removing specific areas of a rat’s cortex, either before or after the animals were trained in mazes and visual discrimination.   Lashley made several fundamental discoveries about how the brain stores and processes information. By implanting insulating chips of mica in rats’ cortexes and showing that they had few effects on learning and behavior, he established that (contra to Gestalt theories of the era) the cortex processed information in the pattern of activity and connectivity among neurons, not in global field and wave effects propagating through a medium. By showing that lesions that undercut slabs of cortex had far more severe consequences lesions that were perpendicular to the cortex, he helped show that the principal circuits of the cortex ran up and down into the white matter rather than side-to-side across the cortical surface. His famously unsuccessful search for the “engram” – the localized trace of the memory for a maze in a trained rat’s brain – led him to propose the principle of "mass action," in which learning is distributed across all parts of the brain rather than stored in a single regions, with the degree of impairment proportional to the amount of brain that was damaged. His complementary principle of "equipotentiality" stated that in the event of damage to one area of the brain, other parts of the brain can sometimes assume the role of the damaged region. Though his views are now considered too extreme, the principle that memories are not localized to a single spot in the brain is now well accepted.
