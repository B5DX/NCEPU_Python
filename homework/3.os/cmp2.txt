In 1951 Lashley published a famous paper called “The Problem of Serial Order in Behavior,” in which he pointed out that complex sequential behavior (such as playing a piece on the piano) could not be executed by one response sending a proprioceptive signal back to the brain which would then trigger the next response in the sequence – there simply wasn’t enough time for the neural signals to travel up to the brain and back down. Instead, behavior had to be controlled by a central, hierarchically organized program. This insight has guided the study of motor behavior ever since, and influenced Noam Chomsky’s critique of Skinner’s theory of language and the development of Chomsky’s theory of generative grammar.
Lashley was a pioneer of neuroscience before the term existed, and seeking to understand the connection between the physical structures of the brain and psychological processes of learning, memory, and planning. He eschewed the theoretical perspectives of his time in an attempt to avoid being hampered by a priori assumptions.  He is listed as number 61 on the American Psychological Associations list of the 100 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century.
